# vision_based_quality_control
 This is the source code for quality control of Vehicle identification number (VIN) using image processing algorithms
 
## Algorithm
step-1 : Take the input image & relavant library image 
step-2 : Extract each letter from input image
step-3 : apply FFT to the extracted letter and library image
step-4 : apply ORB feature matching algorithm
step-5 : define quality constraint to decide the product quality

## dependancies
Opencv
